# [Barcode Beep](http://internetimagery.com/barcode-beep/)

My kids enjoy playing shop, and I went looking for a dead simple mock scanner that they could beep their "shopping" on. I didn't find anything as simple as I wanted, so I put together this little thing.

Please feel free to use it! If you have little ones that it might benefit, or if you enjoy pretending to shop yourself (no judging)!

Just load the above link on a phone / tablet and have at it!

Also feel free to pull/merge request. So long as things remain pretty simple, there is a lot that could be improved.

Enjoy, and have fun!
